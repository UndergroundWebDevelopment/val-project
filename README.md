The VAL Project
===============

VAL is the Virtual Assistant for Your Life.
-------------------------------------------

The VAL project has the lofty goal of creating a virtual assistant program primarily designed to asist with day-to-day life. The following list of features is by no means exhaustive or definite, but is an initial outline to provide some context to the kinds of tasks we envision VAL being able to accomplish.

* Integrated contacts / calendar / to-do list module to help keep you on track with what you need to do and when you need to do it.
* A history and trends module, that tracks all interactions with VAL and enables easy reporting and trend-detection on that data.
* A routine module, designed to help build new routines and convert them to habits.
* A food & diet module, that fascilitates tracking what food was eaten when for nutritional stats, as well as fascilitates an automatically currated grocery list.
* Integration modules for various pedometers, smart scales, and other health hardware.
* Integration modules for various social networks, with the goal of providing a unified interface to your digital life.
* Integration modules for various home / building automation hardwares.

We envisioning VAL as a multi-part system, consisting of at minimum a home server and a mobile app, with the server component handling background monitoring tasks, handling integrations, and managing automation routines, while the mobile app serves primarily as an interface and data-collector.
